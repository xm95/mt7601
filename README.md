## MT7601U Linux driver

本驱动适配MT7601U kali2.0。

Unfortunately, the driver is not part of the Linux kernel source tree (yet?). This repository contains:
* source code from [`DPO_MT7601U_LinuxSTA_3.0.0.4_20130913.tar.bz2`](http://www.mediatek.com/en/downloads/mt7601u-usb/) (md5sum `5f440dccc8bc952745a191994fc34699`) 
* file `DPO_MT7601U_LinuxSTA_3.0.0.4_20130913-Linux-3.17.0-v2.patch`
 has been applied

The patch improves stability and performance for kernels >= 3.x

### Usage

First install kernel-devel for your Linux distro

```
git clone https://github.com/porjo/mt7601.git
cd mt7601/src
make
mkdir -p /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
insmod os/linux/mt7601Usta.ko
```

If the module has loaded OK, you should see `mt7601Usta` listed in the output of `lsmod` and a new network interface `ra0` should be present in the output of `ip link`.

If all goes well, you can permanently install the driver with `make install`.

On 26 Aug, 2014 user **@poma** posted to the [linux-wireless](http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/MailingLists) mailing list discussing the poor state of driver support for this chipset. Thread can be seen here:

An inital patch was released on 28 Aug, 2014 with the following comment:
```
A patch[1] is composed partly from the RT3573 source code patched by ashaffer, from Andreas work, some of the ideas are from the beagleboard community, and some of my. :)
Debug(trace) is turned off.

Device now works more or less OK but slow, max. 10 Mbit, although connectable is only within the "N" & "N/G" modes.
What is important is the system no longer crashes, and disconnection are rare.
Generally better than before.

Tested with kernels:
3.15.10-200.fc20.x86_64
3.16.1-301.fc21.x86_64
3.17.0-0.rc2.git0.1.fc22.x86_64

and with debug kernel:
3.17.0-0.rc2.git1.1.fc22.x86_64
```

A second patch was released on 31 Aug, 2014 with the following comment:

```
A new patch[1] mainly based on patches at 
https://github.com/ashaffer/rt3573sta
and several network throughput tests via the Iperf.
Tested with kernels:
- 3.15.10-200.fc20.x86_64
- 3.16.1-301.fc21.x86_64
- 3.17.0-0.rc2.git3.1.fc22.x86_64
- 3.16.1-301.fc21.i686
- 3.17.0-0.rc2.git3.1.fc22.i686
```
